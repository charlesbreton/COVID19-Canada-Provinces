# Canadian Provinces COVID-19 response: Stringency index and measures

The COVID-19 Stringency Index captures the level of policy restrictions that individuals are living with across Canada and when policy measures were taken. 

The Index is calculated based on twelve different measures enacted by provincial and territorial governments such as gathering sizes, facial coverings, school closures, and travel restrictions. 

Measures capture the most restrictive policy in place at a given time and are flagged to indicate if a policy applies province-wide. Descriptions of what we measure can be found in our [codebook](https://centre.irpp.org/2020/12/government-covid-19-policies-codebook/). 

# Important update
Our codebook was updated on June 29, 2021 to provide a more nuanced evaluation of measures for gatherings (S1) and dining & restaurants (S6). The "Gatherings" indicator now includes seven categories instead of five and the "dining & restaurants" indicator as one additional category.

Data is updated weekly and going forward will follow the new codebook. Legacy data following the old codebook is current as to June 28, 2021 and can be downloaded below but will not be updated going forward.

# Background

This is a project of the [Centre of Excellence on the Canadian Federation]( https://centre.irpp.org/) at the [Institute for Research on Public Policy](http://www.irpp.org) (IRPP), a Montreal-based think tank. Our team developed a complimentary set of indicators for the work of [Oxford Universityâ€™s COVID-19 Government Response Tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/). 

The intended use of this database is to model Canadian policy responses over time and support new scholarship and policy evaluation. You can read more about how relative stringency has varied in our original [Policy Options article]( https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/november-2020/in-the-canadian-federation-pandemic-response-is-hyper-local/), published on November 27th, 2020.

Comments and corrections are welcome.

# COVID-19 Re-opening Indicators
Between March and September 2020, the [Centre of Excellence on the Canadian Federation](https://centre.irpp.org/) tracked Canadian policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic with a specific focus on the timing of public health measures. The re-opening indicators dataset captures when provincial measures were taken or revoked. We based this data collection on [work done in the U.S.]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zu9qEWI8PsOI_i8nI_S29HDGHlIp2lfVMsGxpQ5tvAQ/edit#gid=0) to allow cross-country comparisons. 

The data only tracks the date at which a policy became effective, not when it was announced. When a policy is enacted at midnight, the following day is indicated. We also only account for orders and official directives from provinces not suggestions. You can read more on this COVID provincial re-opening indicators in our original [Policy Options article](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/april-2020/how-the-provinces-compare-in-their-covid-19-responses/), published on April 22nd, 2020.

# COVID-19 Canadian Provinces Measures

Provincial measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data we collected is focused on measures enacted to counter the propagation of COVID-19 (social distanciation, fines, etc.). We based this data collection on [work done in the U.S.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zu9qEWI8PsOI_i8nI_S29HDGHlIp2lfVMsGxpQ5tvAQ/edit#gid=0) to allow cross-country comparisons.

Please note that the data only tracks the date at which a policy became effective, not when it was announced. When a policy is enacted at midnight, the following day is indicated. For Ontario, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, we have treated March 16, the first day of March Break, as the day that school closures took effect even though they were formally applied on March 23, the day students were supposed to return from the break. We also only account for orders and official directives from provinces not suggestions.

The data will be updated to reflect new measures but also to track measures that have been lifted. We are also in the process of adding the territories. 

You can also [look at the data on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11QKjG4urlLSEfM6YOjJm0dpwUVde3cv9iXxawsodw70/edit?usp=sharing)

# COVID-19 Canadian Provinces Measures

Provincial measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data we collected is focused on measures enacted to counter the propagation of COVID-19 (social distanciation, fines, etc.). We based this data collection on [work done in the U.S.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zu9qEWI8PsOI_i8nI_S29HDGHlIp2lfVMsGxpQ5tvAQ/edit#gid=0) to allow cross-country comparisons.

The data will be updated to reflect new measures but also to track measures that have been lifted.

You can also [look at the data on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11QKjG4urlLSEfM6YOjJm0dpwUVde3cv9iXxawsodw70/edit?usp=sharing)

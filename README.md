# COVID-19 Canadian Provinces Responses

Provincial measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The data we collected is focused on measures enacted to counter the propagation of COVID-19 (social distanciation, fines, etc.). We based this data collection on [work done in the U.S.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zu9qEWI8PsOI_i8nI_S29HDGHlIp2lfVMsGxpQ5tvAQ/edit#gid=0) so as to allow cross-country comparisons.

The data will be updated to reflect new measures but also to track measures that have been lifted.
